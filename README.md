# Sort_comparision
Compares various sorting algorithms between python and c++ implementations
over an input range of n = 5^1 - 5^7 random elements.

Three random sets of each interval are averaged to increase stochasticity.


To compile:  
    ``` make ``` Compiles the c++ sorting comparision.  
    ``` make numbers ``` generates the random input files.  
    ``` bin/sort_tester ``` produces the c++ portion of the time files.
