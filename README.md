# Sort_comparision
Compares various sorting algorithms between python and c++ implementations
over an input range of n = 5^1 /- 5^7 random elements.

Three random sets of each interval are averaged to increase stochasticity.  
  
C++ implementation done \- Python in production.  


To compile:  
    ``` make``` Compiles the c++ sorting comparision.  
    ``` make files``` generates the time to sort files in benchmarking (provided /benchmarking exists)
